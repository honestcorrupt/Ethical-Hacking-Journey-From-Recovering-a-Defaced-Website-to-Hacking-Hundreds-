Ethical Hacking Journey: From Recovering a Defaced Website to Hacking Hundreds 🚀🔐
About This Project

This project documents one of the most intense and eye-opening experiences of my cybersecurity career. What started as an attempt to recover a single defaced website quickly turned into uncovering a vast network of hacked websites — all controlled through a single vulnerable backend system.
🔍 My Findings

  ✅ Bypassed the login page using advanced SQL Injection techniques to gain full admin/editor access.

  🌐 Discovered that the backend controls hundreds of websites across multiple domains, all compromised and interconnected.

  💥 Successfully injected persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads that execute malicious scripts on these hacked sites, allowing manipulation of content and hijacking of user sessions.

  ⚠️ Demonstrated how a single critical vulnerability can lead to the mass compromise of an entire ecosystem of websites.

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

   🔓 Expert exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities to bypass authentication mechanisms.

   🎯 Precision crafting and deploying of persistent XSS attacks for long-lasting impact.

   🔎 Deep analysis and navigation of complex web backend systems managing multiple domains.

  🔗 Understanding of multi-domain infrastructures and how chained vulnerabilities escalate risk.

   🤝 Strong ethical hacking principles focusing on responsible disclosure and remediation.

💭 Experience & Reflections

This project was more than just a technical challenge — it was a powerful lesson in the scale of modern cyber threats.

   One vulnerability, if left unchecked, can open the door to hundreds of websites being hacked.

   It reinforced the vital need for organizations to perform regular security audits and patch critical vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.

  It reminded me that ethical responsibility goes beyond finding bugs — it includes helping to secure and protect digital assets.

 This journey fuels my passion for cybersecurity and my commitment to making the internet safer — one bug, one exploit, one fix at a time.

how can i do it ---------- POC

1.Bypass the login with SQL Injection

2. Inject a persistent XSS payload on the item submission page

```
sqli
   -- Step 1: Bypass login (at /editor/login.php)
Username: not to share plz
Password: (anything or empty)

-- This bypasses authentication by making the WHERE clause always true

 html 

<!-- Step 2: Inject persistent XSS payload (at /editor/item.php) -->

<!-- In the "Text" or "Content" field, inject: -->
<script>alert('XSS by honest_corrupt')</script>

<!-- After submitting, this script will execute every time the page is loaded -->

```
How it works:

   The SQL Injection in the login lets you bypass authentication and enter the editor panel.

   In the editor panel, injecting the <script> tag stores malicious JS in the database (persistent XSS).

   When visitors load the page, the script executes, confirming your control.
